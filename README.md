# Customer Churn Analysis Using Power BI

This project showcases an **interactive Power BI report** analyzing customer churn. It highlights patterns and provides actionable insights for customer retention for buisnesses to retain their customers.

## Project Overview:
In this project, I analyzed customer churn based on various attributes such as contract type, tenure, age, and usage. The analysis was done using historical customer data to:
- Visualize churn patterns and identify key factors that contribute to churn.
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for decision-makers to easily view and understand the churn patterns.
- Predict customer churn using visual analytics and provide insights for improving retention strategies.

## Files Included
