# Customer Churn Analysis Using Power BI

This project showcases an **interactive Power BI report** analyzing customer churn. It highlights patterns and provides actionable insights for customer retention for buisnesses to retain their customers.

## Project Overview:
In this project, I analyzed customer churn based on various attributes such as contract type, tenure, age, and usage. The analysis was done using historical customer data to:
- Visualize churn patterns and identify key factors that contribute to churn.
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for decision-makers to easily view and understand the churn patterns.
- Predict customer churn using visual analytics and provide insights for improving retention strategies.

## Files Included
- 'Customer Churn Analysis report.pbix': Power BI report file.
- 'Customer_Churn_Dataset.xlsx': Dataset used for the analysis.

## Key Features:
- *Power BI Dashboard*: Visualizing churn patterns by contract types, contract tenure, and other key customer attributes.
- *Churn Prediction*: Insights to help the business take action to retain customers.
- *Interactive*: The report contains interactive visuals that allow users to explore churn data based on different variables.

## Technologies Used:
- *Power BI* (for data visualization and dashboard creation)
- *Excel/CSV* (for data collection and preparation)
- *DAX* & *Power Query* (for data manipulation, calculations, and transformation)

## Key Terminologies :
1. Churn Rate: 
The percentage of customers who stop using a product or service during a specific time period. It helps businesses measure customer attrition and retention effectiveness.

2. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): 
The predictable revenue generated every month from active customers. It’s essential for understanding revenue stability and growth in subscription-based models.

3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): 
The total revenue a business can expect from a single customer throughout their relationship. It evaluates the long-term value of acquiring and retaining a customer

4. Total Revenue: 
The total amount of money generated by the business from all customers in a specific period, helping gauge overall business performance.

5. Churned Revenue: 
The revenue lost due to customers who stopped using the product or service. It highlights the financial impact of churn and supports strategic planning.

6. Retention Forecast: 
Predictions about the percentage of customers likely to stay engaged/Churn with the business over a specific period, assisting in proactive decision-making for retention strategies.

7. Tenure: 
The length of time a customer has been with the business. It’s used to analyze customer loyalty and behavior trends over time.

8. Customer Segmentation: 
Grouping customers based on attributes like demographics, behavior, or spending patterns. It enables targeted retention strategies and marketing efforts.

## About the Analysis
- *Goal*: To identify churn trends and provide insights for retention strategies.
- *Key Insights*:
  - Shorter contracts (e.g., month-to-month) correlate with higher churn rates.
  - Tenure plays a significant role in retention.
  - Potential churn rates highlight opportunities for proactive engagement.
